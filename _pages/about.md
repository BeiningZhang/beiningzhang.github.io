*"Artificial Intelligence is the elucidation of human learning process, the quantification of human thinking process, the explication of human behaviour, and the understanding of what makes intelligence possible. It is men's final step to understand themselves, and I hope to take part in this new, but the most promising science"* — Dr. Kai-Fu Lee

I am an AI researcher who shares Dr. Kai-Fu Lee’s conviction that AI helps us better understand ourselves. I’m striving to design pro-social, human-centered AI agents and systems that amplify human capabilities, uphold fairness and safety, and contribute to a more equitable and empowering future.

My work bridges AI theory and real-world applications with contributions to trading system monitoring, health system innovation, and trustworthy AI system design. At the London Stock Exchange Group, I automated market monitoring, cutting incident detection time by 30%. At Harvard University Health System Innovation Lab, I developed an LLM-based data annotation framework, reducing manual review efforts by over 40%. Passionate about translating complex business challenges into AI-powered solutions that advance operational excellence and designing desirable, pro-social AI agents and systems that empower human-beings.
