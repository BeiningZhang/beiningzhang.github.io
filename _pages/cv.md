## Professional Experience

---

**Research Collaborator** (Joint work with University of Southampton)
Harvard Health System Innovation Lab | Harvard University | Boston, USA | Nov 2024 - Present

- **Dramatically reduced human labelling effort by over 40%**Â by leading the development of anÂ LLM-powered data annotation pipeline. This system processed and classified aÂ 200,000-record datasetÂ for the health research investment analysis project for theÂ *Lancet Oncology Commission*, achieving aÂ 93% human-machine agreement rate. **[1]**

**Research Assistant**
School of Electronics and Computer Science | University of Southampton | Southampton, UK | June 2024 - Present

- Achieved top ranking in the Concordia Contest 2024 by designing and presenting novel LLM agent architecture for cooperative multi-agent interaction and autonomous decision-making. **[2]**
- Conducted Human-AI Interaction research on designing trustworthy AI systems, with a focus on explainability, AI ethics, governance, and public engagement. **[3]**

**Data Science Intern**
Stellar Fusion | London, UK | Aug 2023 - Oct 2023

- **Accelerated data readiness and ensured data integrity** by developing a robust SQL and Python pipeline to ingest, clean, and structure diverse financial metrics from SEC filings and MongoDB company data.
- **Enabled faster, data-driven investment decisions** by automating report analysis using unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means clustering) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

**Data Science Consultant**
London Stock Exchange Group | London, UK | May 2022 - Jul 2023

- **Significantly enhanced trading system operational efficiency** by leading the Operational Readiness Centre project. This initiative reduced critical incident detection time by 30% through the development of automated, real-time market health monitoring pipelines using AWS (S3, Glue, SageMaker) and delivering actionable insights via PowerBI.
